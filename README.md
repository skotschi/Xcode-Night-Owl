# Xcode-Night-Owl ðŸ¦‰

This is my own slightly customized version of [Sarah Drasnerâ€™s](https://github.com/sdras) Night Owl theme.

## Differences

The font used is Victor Mono for beautiful italics and coding ligatures
Some minor color adjustments for class names, type names and constants

## Installation

Navigate to `/Users/<user_name>/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes`
Copy the contents of the `themes` folder into the directory
Open Xcode and open the preferences
In the `Fonts & Colors`tab, select `Night Owl` or `Light Owl` from the list.
